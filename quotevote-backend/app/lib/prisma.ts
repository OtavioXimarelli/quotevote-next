/**
 * Application-Level Prisma Client Singleton
 *
 * Provides a single shared PrismaClient instance for the entire application.
 * Uses globalThis caching to prevent multiple instances during development
 * hot-reloads (ts-node-dev --respawn).
 *
 * ## Injection Path
 *
 * **GraphQL resolvers** must always access Prisma through `context.prisma`,
 * which is injected by the context factory (`app/context.ts`). This ensures
 * the client is mockable in tests and consistent across the request lifecycle.
 *
 * **Direct imports** (`import { prisma } from '~/lib/prisma'`) should be
 * limited to:
 *   - Process startup / shutdown (`app/server.ts`, `app/context.ts`)
 *   - CLI scripts and seeds (`scripts/`)
 *
 * Importing the singleton directly in a resolver bypasses the factory and
 * makes the client impossible to inject or mock in unit tests.
 *
 * @see app/context.ts  — Context factory that injects prisma into resolvers
 * @see https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management
